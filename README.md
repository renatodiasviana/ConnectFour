# ConnectFour

It's a simple old game.

This project is a demonstration of gamedev programming skills using Unity. 

Skills showed:

1) UI programming
2) Input programming
3) Gameplay programming
4) AI programing (Min Max algorithm)
5) Shader programming

Assets used:

1) ConnectFourBackground.png (Created by Renato Dias Viana)

Decisions:

1) I created a game in one scene because of the time to deliver the game.
2) I created two shaders used for simple effects (First one shows all four winner pieces, second one is a fading effect when reseting the game)
3) I created three levels of difficulty in AI moves and you can change it during the game

Game difficulties:

1) Easy - Random AI moves
2) Medium - MinMax algorithm with max level tree set to 3
3) Hard - MinMax algorithm with max level tree set to 5
